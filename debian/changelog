ros-hydro-descartes-trajectory (0.0.2-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Created two new base class methods for trajectory points: clone and copy that preserve the prior semantics while making sure that the underlying data type is copied correctly
  * Added install to CMakeLists.txt
  * Merge pull request #85 <https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/descartes/issues/85> from `ros-industrial-consortium/issue_#84 <https://github.com/ros-industrial-consortium/issue_/issues/84>`__incorrect_cartesian_discretization
    Incorrect cartesian point discretization
  * uses const references in all range-based for loops that used auto type deduction
  * added computeCartesionPoses method which is invoked by any method that needs to discretize the cartesian pose such getCartesianPoses and getJointPoses
  * Added line on main page to document axial symmetric pt
  * Added documentation
  * finds the closest pose in joint space when ik for the closest cartesian pose fails
